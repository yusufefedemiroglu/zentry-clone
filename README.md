# Zentry Clone - Frontend Showcase

This project is a clone of the stunning website **Zentry.com**, created to showcase my frontend development skills. The goal of this clone is to replicate the beautiful UI, animations, and interactive features of the original website, while demonstrating my expertise in modern frontend technologies like **ReactJS**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **GSAP**.

- **Smooth Animations**: Elegant animations and transitions that replicate the original design's interactivity, powered by **GSAP**.
- **ReactJS**: Built using ReactJS for component-based architecture and reactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styled using Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with a utility-first approach.
